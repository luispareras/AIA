0,What is the difference between biotechnology and synthetic biology?," The discipline of synthetic biology integrates engineering, chemistry and molecular biology for the creation and management of biological systems to solve issues in energy, materials, health and environment. Synthetic biology was founded in 1983 by Thomas Cech, but entered into mainstream use in 2002 when it was advocated as a means to address the global need for clean and cheap biofuels. Like the term biotechnology, the term ""synthetic biology"" covers a broad range of applications and processes, that may be loosely divided into two major tracks: Biology as a technological platform / technologies -> Synthetic biology represents a new technological platform, based on biology. The goal of the synthetic biology is to make useful organic molecules, materials, etc. in a economically viable and environmentally friendly fashion. In this sense, synthetic biology is applied biotechnology. Synthetic biology, a rising star -> Synthetic biology on the other hand, is a discipline in its own right, that applies engineering principles to biological systems to improve their function within the economy. In this sense, it is applied synthetic biology. Overall, synthetic biology can be divided into three great challenges. These challenges overlap and when properly addressed, will support societal goals relating to health, environment and sustainability. -> 1. Enabling genetic programming -> The first major challenge is to enable a technology that allows predictably programming living organisms. In this context, the practice of synthetic biology has moved the front lines of biology by creating the first organisms whose genomes are widely dissimilar to those of their progenitors. Recently, research efforts have quickly converged on a single workable approach; controlling transcription. Thus, the second challenge is how to use synthetic biology tools to program gene transcription to make cells that produce specially desired cellular components or metabolites. -> 2. Programming in vivo physiology -> The next challenge is how synthetic biology those cell types with functions that enable new or improved use cases. Current work in this arena is improving the direct production of desired compounds from biological sources, such as alkanes, salicyclic acid, glutamic acid and 2,3Butandiol (2,3 Bdtol. The third challenge is how to repurpose the presence of cells in vivo to perform new functions. Here, our greatest success is the transplantation of bioengineered strains of bacteria into lethally irradiated animals, where the bacteria formed natural bacteria-host lysosomes that repair the gut epithelium in the mice and provide a living scannable model of immunotherapeutic cell microenvironment. -> 3. Programming synthetic life -> Molecules, cells, tissues and organisms assume a wide scope of folded and functional 3D shapes. On one hand, synthetic biology platforms provide technologies and approaches to create 3D-structures from synthetic, non-natural foldamers, connectors and regulatory domains. Some examples are programmable micro/nano-robots or origami-based substrates for photovoltaics, etc. On the other hand, research in synthetic biology has touched on the limits of present knowledge. Several groups are ablating or less-invasively engineering genomes of self-replicating living cells. This field, called confined synthetic biology, strives to achieve their long term goal of synthesizing genomes from assembler-like components. Moreover, we are seeing the first set of attempts to synthetically design and synthesize an entire, self-replicating genome, known as an archetypal minimal genome approach. Beyond minimal genomes, early proof-of-principles have explored strategies to convert chemically inorganic matter into minimal genomes. The first instances of digital life are likely to be static, in tandem with natural information-storage systems, such as the ribosome, DNA, or RNA. They will be read once and then cannot be rewritten. But soon we will be able to write, rewrite, and potentially erase digital genomes. In parallel, synthetic biology is poised to enter a realm, where we can design and fabricate synthetic organisms from within laboratories. Such synthetic life will probably start from a sequence of bases (e.g. in which redundancy has been reduced) and might enter a habitable genus of minimal and synthetic life. Thereafter it might be rewritten, shared and disseminated onto Web servers. The ensuing discussions about societal risks and benefits will be a challenge for the synthetic biology research community. -> Overall, the changes in synthetic biology are expected to mirror the changes we have seen in computing and in the communications industries over the past half-century. Within the space of a few years, this will lead to the emergence of an entirely new part of the economy that merges the application of biology with engineering to create radically new and transformative ways of using biology to develop new products and services.",7,"  The main difference between biotechnology and synthetic biology is that biotechnology is the use of living organisms or their components to make products that are useful to humans, while synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, and the re-design of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes.",4,"  The main difference between biotechnology and synthetic biology is that biotechnology uses living organisms or their components to produce products, while synthetic biology creates artificial biological parts, devices, and systems.",6,0.9,1.0,2.0,2.0,1000.0,1.0
